<div class="textblock"><p>This project consists of 2 main subsystems: <a class="el" href="classImage.html" title="A class that holds content representing a PNG image. ">Image</a> processing and the Rescue simulation</p>
<p><em><b>1. Image Processing:</b></em> subsystem in charge of applying image filters on images stored locally on your machine. Specifically, the subsystem is designed to implement a Canny Edge detection, yet it also allows for more image filtering extensibility if the user desires to add more filters.</p>
<p>Our design follows a facade design pattern, the complexity of the system is hidden and the <a class="el" href="classImageProcessor.html" title="A class that applies any filter. ">ImageProcessor</a> behaves as the interface for a user to interact with. The Image Processor contains the possible filters that can be applied to an image, such as <code>greyscale</code> and <code>canny-edge-detect</code>, and has a dependency to <a class="el" href="classImage.html" title="A class that holds content representing a PNG image. ">Image</a>, which means that an <a class="el" href="classImage.html" title="A class that holds content representing a PNG image. ">Image</a> is not held by the <a class="el" href="classImageProcessor.html" title="A class that applies any filter. ">ImageProcessor</a> but rather the <a class="el" href="classImageProcessor.html" title="A class that applies any filter. ">ImageProcessor</a> interacts with the <a class="el" href="classImage.html" title="A class that holds content representing a PNG image. ">Image</a> class through the ApplyFiler method based on any <a class="el" href="classFilter.html" title="Abstract class that defines the virtual methods for all filter classes. ">Filter</a> type passed as an input parameter. The <code>sobel</code> and <code>non-max</code> filters were only designed as if they were being used as part of the canny edge detection, therefore the <a class="el" href="classImage.html" title="A class that holds content representing a PNG image. ">Image</a> Processor cannot directly implement these two filters. Moreover, it was assumed that any image passed to the <a class="el" href="classImage.html" title="A class that holds content representing a PNG image. ">Image</a> Processor as input existed on the filesystem.</p>
<div class="image">

</div>
<p>Images read in from the filesystem are represented as an instance of the <a class="el" href="classImage.html" title="A class that holds content representing a PNG image. ">Image</a> class, in which each <a class="el" href="classColor.html" title="A class that represents a pixel.

">Image</a>, thereby an <a class="el" href="classImage.html" title="A class that holds content representing a PNG image. ">Image</a> contains a unique pointer to an array of Colors.</p>

<p><em><b>2. Rescue Simulation:</b></em> subsystem that consists of creating a simulation in which a drone searches for a robot in a scene. This subsystem uses a web-based visualization system provided by the CSCI3081 staff.</p>
<p>In the simulation there are multiple patterns that were used in order to build an extensible simulation. First, the facade design pattern was implemented in order to allow the complexity of the system to be hidden behind a class called <a class="el" href="classRescueSimulation.html" title="A facade to start, interact, and end a rescue simulation. ">RescueSimulation</a>.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="../pages/images_uml/Rescue_Simulation.png" alt="Rescue Simulation uml diagram" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>In order to build the Entities, we decided to use an inheritance hierarchy as that will allow for entities to share common attributes like a position or an entityID (to name a few).</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="../pages/images_uml/Entities.png" alt="All entities uml diagram" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>The Factory pattern was used to create Entities (robot, drone, hospital...etc). No entity was created in the simulation directly, rather the simulation contains a composite factory that when it receives the command to create an entity it passes the <code>picsonjson</code> command to the <code>CreateEntity(...)</code> method and the appropriate factory class handles the correct entity creation.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="../pages/images_uml/Entity_Factory.png" alt="Factory Pattern uml diagram" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>Additionally,the Strategy pattern was implemented for the <a class="el" href="classDrone.html">Drone</a> movement, thereby the <a class="el" href="classDrone.html">Drone</a> will rely on a member variable that points to an instance of the <a class="el" href="classIMovement.html" title="An Interface for any Movement Strategy. ">IMovement</a> class to generate the set of 3D vectors the drone must move to depending on its status: looking for the robot and going to the robot will correspond to patrol and beeline movement respectively. This delegation of movement is necessary as this will allow for other objects to be added to the “movable” property more easily, if the program was to be extended.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="../pages/images_uml/Movement.png" alt="Strategy Pattern for Movement uml diagram" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>Finally, in order to allow for searching the drone we created an <a class="el" href="classObjectDetector.html" title="A class used to detect the orange Robot within a given image. ">ObjectDetector</a> class that uses the open-source <code>opencv</code> library, rather than our Image Processing subsystem, to perform blob detection and canny edge detect as that ended up being a much faster approach than using our filters, which took 15 sec to process a single image.</p>
